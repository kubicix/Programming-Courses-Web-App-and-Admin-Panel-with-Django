# Programming Courses Blog 

This repository contains the source code of my Django-based web application that aims to deliver a platform for programming courses. The website has a functional login page, admin panel, and is built using the Django Framework.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The website provides a secure login system where users can register, log in, and log out.
- **Admin Panel**: Through the Django's built-in admin panel, administrators can manage users, courses, and other website content.
- **Programming Courses**: The platform provides a variety of programming courses. Each course consists of multiple lessons and resources.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Django 3.1+

## Usage

### User Side

- Register a new account or log into an existing one from the login page.
- After logging in, users can browse and enroll in programming courses.
